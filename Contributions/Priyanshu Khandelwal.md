Hello I am Priyanshu khandelwal,

My thoughts about HacktoberFest:- Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community. It is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. The goal of the event is to encourage participation in the open-source community all across the globe. And the challenge is quite simple. Last year i participated in the Hacktoberfest2020 and i got a T-shirt with the stickers. I enjoyed a lot in making the 4 PR pull requests for open source contribution.
